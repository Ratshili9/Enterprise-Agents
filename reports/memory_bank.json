            "insight": "Insight 1: The Disproportionate Impact of Smoking, Even at Young Ages:** While smoking is known to increase costs, the data suggests its financial impact is so profound that it often overshadows and distorts other cost drivers like age. For instance, a 19-year-old smoker's charges (`16,884.9`) can already exceed the 75th percentile of the *entire* dataset (`16,657.7`). This indicates that being a smoker, regardless of youth, immediately places an individual into a high-cost category, making it a primary, high-magnitude driver of overall variance and top-tier expenditures."
